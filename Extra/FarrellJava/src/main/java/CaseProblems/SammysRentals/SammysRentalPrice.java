2.  Sammy's Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach
    chairs, and umbrellas to tourist. Write a program that prompts the user for the
    number of minutes  he rented a piece of sports equipment. Compute the rental
    cost as %50 pre hour plus %1 per additional minute. ( YOu might have surmised
    already taht this rate has a logical flaw, but for no, calculate rates as described
    here. YOu can fix the problem after you read teh chapter on decision making.)
    Display Sammy's motto with the border that you created in th SammysMotto2
    class in Chapter 1. Then display the hours, minutes, and total price. Save the file
    as SammysRentalPrice.java.
