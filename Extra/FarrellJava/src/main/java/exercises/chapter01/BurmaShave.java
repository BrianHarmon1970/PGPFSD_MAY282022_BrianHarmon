12. From 1925 throu 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways all across the Unites States.
    There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme., followed by a final sign that
    read "Burma Shave."
    For example one set of signs reads as follows:

    Shaving brushes
    You'll soon see 'em
    On a shelf
    In some museum
    Burma Shave

    Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web. Write, compiile and test a class
    that produce aa series of four dialog boxes so that each display one line fo a Burma Shave slogn in turn.
    Save the class as BurmaShave.java


     In 1934, drivers would have seen this diddy along the road:

He had the ring
he had the flat
but she felt his chin
and that
was that
Burma-Shave

However, they, much like ourselves, sometimes dove into slightly more serious topics with verses
warning against things such as drunk driving. For example, this verse from 1940:

It's best for
one who hits
the bottle
to let another
use the throttle
Burma-Shave

public class BurmaShave
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "He had the ring" ) ;
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "he had the flat" ) ;
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "but she felt his chin" ) ;
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "and that" ) ;
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, "was that." ) ;
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "Burma-Shave" ) ;
    }
}
