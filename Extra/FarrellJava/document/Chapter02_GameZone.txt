1.  Mad Libs is a children's game in which they provide a few words that are then
    incorporated into a silly story. The game helps children understand different
    parts of speech because they are asked to provide specific typs of words. For
    example, you might ask a child for a noun, another nmoun, and adjective , and a
    past tense verb. The child might reply with such answers as tabler, book, silly,
    and studied. The newly crated Mad LIb might be:

    Mary had a little table
    Its book was silly as snow
    And everywhere that Mary studied
    The table was sure to go.

2.  Create a Mad Libs program that asks the user to provide at least four or five
    words, and then create and display a short story or nursery rhyme that uses them.
    Save the file as MadLib.java.

3.  In the "Game Zone" section in Chapter 1, you learned how to obtain a random
    number. For example, the following statement generates a random number
    between the constants MIN and MAX inclusive and assigns it to a variable named
    random:

    random = MIN + (int)(Math.random() * MAX) ;

    Write a program that selects a random number between 1 and 5 and asks
    the user to guess the number. Display a message that indicates the difference
    between the random number and the user's guess. Display another message that
    displays the random number and the boolean value true or false depending
    on whether the user's guess equals the random number. Save the file as
    RandomGuessMatch.java
