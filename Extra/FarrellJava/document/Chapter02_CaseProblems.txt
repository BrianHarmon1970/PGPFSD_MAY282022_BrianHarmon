Java Programming, Joyce Farrell
Chapter 2 Case Problems

1.  Carly's Catering provides meals for parties and special events.
    Write a program that prompts the user for the number of guests attending an event and then
    computes teh total price, which is $35 pre person. Display the company motto
    with the border that you created in the CarlysMotto2 class in Chapter 1,
    and then display the number of guest, pricer pre guest, and total price. Also
    display  a message that indicates true or false depending on whether the job
    is classified as a large event -- and event with 50 or more guests. Save the file as
    CarlysEventPrice.java.

2.  Sammy's Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach
    chairs, and umbrellas to tourist. Write a program that prompts the user for the
    number of minutes  he rented a piece of sports equipment. Compute the rental
    cost as %50 pre hour plus %1 per additional minute. ( YOu might have surmised
    already taht this rate has a logical flaw, but for no, calculate rates as described
    here. YOu can fix the problem after you read teh chapter on decision making.)
    Display Sammy's motto with the border that you created in th SammysMotto2
    class in Chapter 1. Then display the hours, minutes, and total price. Save the file
    as SammysRentalPrice.java.
