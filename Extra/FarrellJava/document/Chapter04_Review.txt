// Chapter 4 Review

1.  The code between a pair of curly braces in a method is a ________.
        c. block

2.  When a block exists within another block, the blocks are _________.
        d. nested

3.  The portion of a program within which you can reference a variable is the
    variable's ________.
        a. scope

4.  You can declare variables with the same name multiple times ________.
        c. within a method

5.  If you declare a variable as an instance variable within a class, and you declare
    and use the same variable name within a method of the class, then within the
    method, ________.
        a. the variable used inside the method takes precedence.

6.  A method variable ________ a class variable with the same name.
        c. overrides

7.  Non-ambiguous, overloaded methods must have the same ________.
        d. name

8.  If a method is written to receive a double parameter, and you pass an integer to
    the method, then the method will __________.
        a. work correctly; the integer will be promoted to a double.

9.  A constructor ________ parameters.
        a. can receive

10. A constructor ________ overloaded.
        a. must be - ( unless  you do not define a constructor, in which case
                        the automatic default constructor is used. )
            by definition a constructor uses the name of the class as its own
            and therefore, any constructor that is not the only constructor must overload.
        d. is always automatically - as long as you create any constructor
            the automatic default is overloaded. ( unless the compiler absolutely
            does not provide automatic default in the case where you create the default
            constructor yourself. supposing then that you do and there is no other constructor,
            in this case the answer is

            c. can be... but this implies that it does not have to be which is in general not
            true at all, as in every other case of constructor construction.
            if and only if there is one and only one constructor supplied (whether by user or by compiler)
            as the default parameterless constructor is this true.
            ( you don't have to overload the constructor if you do not create one - if you supply the default one
                yourself, you are not overloading but rather replacing the compiler supplied default).
        not -
            b. cannot be
            I may as well mention it by now. if it's not overloading on the class name it can't be a constructor
            of the class. this is the only answer that is clearly not true.

11. Usually, you want each instantiation of a class to have its own copy of
    ________.
        a. the data fields

12. If you create a class that contains one method, and instantiate two objects, you
    usually store ________ for use with the objects.
        d. data only ( the methods are not stored. )

13. The this reference ________.
        a. can be used implicitly

14. Methods that you reference with individual objects are ________.
        d. nonstatic

15  Variables that are shared by every instantiation of a class are ________.
        a. class variables

16. The keyword final used with a variable declaration indicates ________.
        c. a symbolic constant

17. Java classes are stored in a folder or ________.
        c. package

18  Which of the following statements determines the square root of a number and
    assigns it to the variable s?
        b. s = Math.sqrt( number ) ;

19. A LocalDate object ________.
        d. all of the above -
            can be displayed as a String,
            contains static fields with data such as the current year
            is created using a public default constructor

20. Which of the following expressions correctly returns an integer that represents
    the month of a LocalDate object named hireDate?
        c. hireDate.getMonthValue() ;
