1.  a.  Carly's Catering provides meals for parties and special events. In Chapter 3,
        you created an Event class for the company. The Event class contains two
        public final static fields that hold the price per guest($35) and the
        cutoff value for a large event (50 guests), and three private fields that hold
        an event number, number of guest for the event, and the price. It also
        contains two public set methods and three public get methods.

        Now, modify the Event class to contain two overloaded constructors.

        One constructor accepts an event number and number of guests as parameters.
        Pass these values to the setEventNumber() and setGuests() methods,
        respectively. The setGuests() method will automatically calculate the event price.

        The other constructor is a default constructor that passes "A000" and 0 to the
        two-parameter constructor.

        Save the file as Event.java.

    b.  In Chapter 3, you also created an EvenDemo class to demonstrate using two
        Event objects. Now, modify that class to instantiate two Event objects, and
        include the following new methods in the class:

        Instantiate on object to retain the constructor default values.

        Accept user data for the event number and guests fields, and use this data set
        to instantiate the second object. Display all the details for both objects.

        Save the file as EventDemo.java

2.  a.  Sammy's Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes,
        beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. In Chapter 3, you created a Rental
        class for the company. The Rental class contains two public final static
        fields that hold the n umber of minutes in an hour and the hourly rental rate
        ($40), and four private fields that hold a contract number, number of hours
        for the rental, number of minutes over an hour, and teh price. It also contains
        two public set methods and four public get methods.

        Now, modify the Rental class to contain two overloaded constructors.
        One constructor accepts a contract number and number of minutes

        as parameters. Pass these values to the setContractNumber() and
        setHoursAndMinutes() methods, respectively. The setHoursAndMinutes()
        method will automatically calculate the hours, extra minutes, and price.

        The other constructor is a default constructor that passes "A000" and 0 to the
        two-parameter constructor.

        Save the file as Rental.java

    b.  In Chapter 3, you also created a REntalDemo class to demonstrate a REntal
        object. Now, modify that class to instantiate two REntal objects.

        Instantiate on object to retain the constructor default values.

        Accept user data for the contract number and minutes fields and use this data
        set to instantiate th second object. Display all the details for both objects.

        Save the file as RentalDemo.java.
